## Certificate

The certificates are documents required to atest that the supplier is a valid company. The certificates are required to be uploaded by the supplier and can be downloaded by the school. This is a requirement by the State to ensure that the supplier has no legal issues and is able to supply the school.

For example, the supplier must provide a certificate that proves that their company has no debts with the State. The school can then download this certificate to ensure that the supplier is a valid company.

It is merely consultative, as the supplier can send any document and the school can download it without any validation, it is implemented as a facilitator for the school to check the supplier's legal status. In any case, if the school has any doubts, it can request the supplier to send the certificate by email.
